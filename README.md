I made this Calculator by using HMTL5, CSS, and NODEJS. I'm sure this gonna blow your mind ðŸ™ƒ casue it's fantastic. It's working well . There is some issues like data overflow, when we try to insert more data into the output screen. I try to resolve this issue but it's not resolve completely ðŸ˜Œ. I wish anyone of you can solve this issue or in future I'll surely fix this issue as soon as possible. Rather than this , it's working smoothly you can try this calculator for fun.. I mean you visit my repo, atleast you should check it once and leave your feedback ðŸ™ƒ..Thank you!!
